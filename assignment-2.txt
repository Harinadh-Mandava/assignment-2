--observations:
--Weight and horsepower: Given the wide variety of vehicle types in the dataset, these variables probably show a lot of variation. The mean values may be skewed upward by the existence of outliers, such as very heavy or powerful cars.
--Accel: Since cars usually fall within similar ranges of acceleration for practical usability, it may exhibit less fluctuation than weight and horsepower.
